Netlogo implementation of dryland models
========================================

Netlogo is a user-friendly simulation environment for agent based models that can be used for cellular automata and system dynamics as well. 

Netlogo can be used to communicate and explore the dynamics, since the user can modify the parameter settings live and see directly how the model responds. 

This repository is intended for a series of models to explore the dynamics of dryland vegetation, initially developped in the projects DRYEX and DRYEX2.

  

## How to use

First, you need to [download and install the latest version of NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml).

Then launch the program and open (File/open) one of the .nlogo files.
